It may happen after surgery or if something blocks the airways. Treatment depends on the cause and how serious it is.",
    
    "Cardiomegaly": "‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiomegaly means your heart is bigger than normal. It can happen because of high blood pressure or heart disease. A large heart may not pump blood well and can make you feel tired or short of breath. Doctors may do more tests to find the reason and give treatment.",
    
    "Consolidation": "üå´Ô∏è Consolidation happens when part of your lung becomes solid instead of filled with air. This usually means there is an infection like pneumonia. It can cause cough, chest pain, and fever. You may need antibiotics or other treatment to help clear the infection.",
    
    "Edema": "üíß Edema in the lungs means fluid has built up inside your lungs. This makes it hard to breathe and can feel like pressure or tightness in the chest. It can be caused by heart, kidney, or lung problems. Treatment includes removing the fluid and treating the cause.",
    
    "Effusion": "üåä Pleural effusion is when there is too much fluid between the lungs and the chest wall. This can make it hard to take deep breaths and cause chest pain. It may be caused by infection, cancer, or heart failure. Doctors may drain the fluid and treat the root cause.",
    
    "Infiltration": "üåÅ Infiltration shows up as blurry areas on your lung X-ray. It means something like fluid, infection, or inflammation is inside your lungs. This can happen with pneumonia or other lung diseases. You might need more tests and medicines depending on the cause.",
    
    "Mass": "üéØ A mass is a large, unusual area in the lungs. It can be non-cancerous or cancerous. Doctors usually do more scans or a biopsy to find out what it is. It's important to check and treat it early if needed.",
    
    "Nodule": "üîµ A nodule is a small round spot seen in your lung. Many nodules are harmless, but some need checking for early signs of cancer or infection. Doctors may suggest follow-up X-rays or scans to watch if it grows.",
    
    "Pneumonia": "ü¶† Pneumonia is a lung infection that fills air sacs with fluid or pus. It can cause cough, fever, chest pain, and trouble breathing. It is usually treated with antibiotics and rest. In some cases, hospital care may be needed.",
    
    "Pneumothorax": "üéà Pneumothorax means air has leaked into the chest and made your lung collapse. It can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. It needs quick medical help to remove the air and let the lung heal."
